"""I give him a week."" 
""I give him 11 minutes.""
Seriously I don't expect anyone to last long until an actual election takes place."
Watched his interview with Piers Morgan & he actually came across as a really nice down to earth person!
"He energizes and inspires even an American such as myself. But actions speak louder than words. I hope he delivers what he has promised. Best wish to you, Mr. Prime Minister!"
"Promising speech, but it doesn't take away from the revolving door of chaos. Hope he does do better than his predecessors, but as he says ""trust is earned"""
"These are such trying times. Even for the country and for you Rishi Sanuk. You are guard of an empty treasure.
Wish you luck and hope you do well. ❤️"
Ukraine people you lot are welcome  here considering the  circumstances in your country ❤️ goes out to all of you much love
"Promising speech, wishing PM Sunak the very best!"
"Sheesh, I didn’t know Great Britain had a PM of Indian descent. The world is changing more quickly than I thought. Didn’t think western world had it in them but talk about leading the way. kudos Great Britain. From Australia 🇦🇺"
I am proud of you as an Asian. Go for it and please make the world better for all people.
Perfect man for UK! I might finally visit!!
"time makes the heroes,and time will tell if he is good at it"
Great speech. Good luck from India. All the best.
"Congratulations Mister Rishi Sunak ! I trust in you ... !  ---   It will be difficult certenly but we have to go forward,  be positiv and become more diplomatic ....  - and -  looking for PEACE !  I look forward to your government !"
Very handsome and very vocal in righteous power!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great speech my brother ❤️🙏
"I Heard the word Compassion 🕵🏽‍♀️☝🏼

Hopefully he does better than the pervious ones. Good luck to him.
Doing a good job.
"wish all the best to Rishi Sunak to energise UK and the world. Future time is challenging to both UK and the world, wish he won the both and get good name for India too🙏.
He and Liz Truss shall join hands to take the world from tough times"
"As he delivers this speech, imagine him dressed as Woody from Toy Story. Better still, would be Tom Hanks voicing over."
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone who reads this will be successful in life..."
आज दुनिया भारत को सिखा रही है कि काबलियत हमें कहीं भी पहुंचा सकती है सिर्फ़ भारत को छोड़ कर🌹इसीलिए भारतीय पलायन कर रहे हैं
"Good Luck! 
USA needs someone like him secure our boarder, social security and protect its citizens. ✌️"
Who would have thought this could happen during britains brutal colonialism in India.
Impressive speach
"I feel the urge to write this,'They threw him under the bus.They gave him an empty treasure box.They abondoned the building and left him inside.'"
I’m still just hoping he’s a doing good job.
Hello everybody how are you doing I hope everybody doing good i wish him good luck i wish Mr prime minister do good job for united Kingdom and for people thanks you mr prime minister and big thanks you people i love everyone 👍✌️
May God bless this beautiful soul.....
He's the most plausible leader the conservatives have offered up in a long time. British politics has been broken for a long time. Best of luck to Riahi to turn that around x
"You can’t tell me that the press and his colleagues actually took in a word he said when a song like that is playing in the background!🤘🏼🤣. I’m sorry, but I dare anyone to try listening to this video all the way through without singing along to it in your head.........😅"
Norman Lamont (John Major’s ex-Chancellor) said this was the best acceptance speech by a PM since Margaret Thatcher. Let’s see how he goes (it’s an uphill struggle created by his own party) but for now I’m just relieved Truss and Boris are gone.
There is a lot of pressure but try to understand the people their incomes are doing much less than before. I wish you all the best
Best of wishes to you Sir
"Best of luck Mr. Prime Minister, We hope the best for UK and the globe under your leadership."
Promising speech but actions speak louder than words
I'll believe it when I see it...until then these are just words...like his predecessors they're good at talking the talk...
Congratulations sir God bless you 🙏
I think the king's relationship with Jesus may be about the people just borrowing the king’s money. I also think that the governor of the central bank and the bank’s relationship with the king may be about a class society lending the king's money in exchange e.g. Bankrate and that this should be investigated.
"Liz Truss' PM Speed Run will be a hard time record to be, can Tory Contender Rishi Sunak beat her amazing U.K. record?  Let's find out!"
"Poor Prime Minister Sunak gave this address exactly while a partial solar eclipse was visible in the UK and most of Europe, with its darkest peak (about 85%) over Moscow, Russia. There couldn´t be a more inauspicious moment, but it wasn't his choice. Wishing him and the UK all the best and success."
👏👏👏👏👍👌
All the best. Hope you do well 👍🙏
"Proof of the pudding Rishi! I await the result- definitely hit the ground running and you are right the country must have growth in any part of the budget - how about corporation tax at 19% not  25% cost 19 billion but an underpinning of our economy and its competitiveness! Don’t forget law and order ,Grooming gangs, making the best of Brexit as you have said 🙏"
Congratulations and i hope you would be a great and promising prime Minister of britan to vanish the economic crisis and create more sources to the people.
Vary good Rishi sunka
You  greater  than the priests  . Pastors  of christianity  by practicing  spiritual   culture  .  Adoption  and adaptation  is more important  .  Long live Rishi   with health  and wealth  . GOD bless you  all abundantly  .
"Every beginning has an end 
Soon or later!!!

from Azerbaijan Tebriz greetings eyvallah you proudness of AtaTurk fo UK
Hope he does well and is not all talk like the ones before him. It do not matter were your background is from if he comes to do better lets be logical and not radicals.
"Yep, he's a ruling ""elite"" ..translation: we all need to sacrifice.... means the rich will have taxes lowered and working people will get austerity and the bill for the country's debt."
Wish u good luck.  Do best to them.
I am praying for u the new prime Minister u sound very sincere and that's what the world needs is some one like u to run things you sound for real keep the faith.

"""British ruled India""
Rishi Sunak : ""UNO reverse card"""
"I’m japanese
His English is quite easy for me to catch 
Is his English natural to you who speak English natively?"
"Seems a long time since we had a proper Prime Minister ,Rishi is definitely that ."
The U.K's going through Prime Ministers like someone with a bag of potato chips. 🥔
Indeed !! sun ever set on the British empire congratulations Brit’s for new beginning
Financial contingency planning focuses on the financial resources is necessary to keep economy solvent and operational during crisis
About time - high hopes!
"We all have faith in you Mr Sunak, the pound has already gone up & I hope that’s only the beginning!"
"I'm very glad to see GB elect a man of a different background, yet also surprised because of the centuries of subtrigation of the hindus.. We truly have turned a corner on prejudices and hopefully this man will show that no matter the skin color or national background he can lead GB into the future."

American wish u do well sir
"Austerity level 100 here we come. Can't wait to hear the man sitting on a $730,000,000 fortune tell us how we will all need to make sacrifices."
"""Form a government in his name (the king) l will never get used to how ridiculous that sounds."
Very punctual.
Good speech. I suppose that's what is needed.
*Sunak is in the top 0.001% richest in the UK and is married to a billionaire* Let that sink in.
Good speech but please get things done unlike the 2 last mistakes we had to put in the office.
He was great throughout covid. I want to believe in him
Dam he seem legit he got no love at all in the end this world quit to disrespect people with class and dignity
We want general election!!!!
"wow! it's wonderful! 
이렇게 영어발음을 멋지고 정확하게  헉!   영화속에서 나오는 말처럼 멋있네  
다 알아듣겠네 발음이  너무 좋다 !  영어공부는 총리 발음을 듣고 따라하기"
"Integrity? It took only 2 days for Rishi to start appointing his friends, even the incompetent ones. Not a good sign. And under the circumstances, I am sure we had hoped for more from our new PM. 

This clearly answers the question as to whether or not the UK should hold an election."
Well done 👍✅✅✅
"Baron Thomas Macaulay: “Yes, I did it!”"
"yes, lets have unity. this from the man who boasted at tory hustings that he has diverted funds meant to help the poor to richer constituencies because they vote tory."
"based on the speech, he may stay for 70-90 days, no more"
"Welcome, PM Sunak! 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👏👏👏👏"
"Churchill was a Prime Minister.
Attlee was a Prime Minister.
David Loyd George was a Prime Minister.
Even Sir Robert Peel was a Prime Minister.

But who is the Prime Minister today?  My, how much has this once glorious office descended in respect."
Nice to see someone who leader doesn't wear adult diapers.
I overheard this speech and thought it was Tony Blair speaking until I actually watched the video.
Wishing him to shine like diamond 😁😄
"Rishi Sunak is a short man with a long face.
I estimate his height to be 4.5 feet tall or 137 cm."
👍👍
Good luck and best wishes!
"Rich people don’t pay taxes and don’t go to prison. Is Rishi going to allow non-dom status? 
Yes, especially for his Indian wife. We need angeneral election now！( petitions can still signed Now)"
Sir  good  luck  sir have good day  sir god bless you and your family  ok sir indian people  around you  ok sir
Lots of Indian comments saying how proud they are of an Indian PM of the UK. Wonder how many would be proud of Boris becoming leader of India
Present his lecture with subtitles.  Thanks
Give him a chance
"The only difference between Sunak  and his two predecessors Truss and Johnson is that he’s got a more eclectic cerebral understanding of the economy and finance rather than just preaching bluster and instinct.  

However they all preach the same Thatcherite neoliberal failed ideology which is the underlying cause of the economic crisis and Sunak, despite his attempts at economic pragmatism and intelligent oratory will be no more capable of fixing it than anyone else.

Moreover the very fact Truss and Sunak contested for eight weeks a time wasting contest where Truss won with the members but now they’ve  changed around in 44 days just highlights how corroded and warped this Tory government is. 

Remember.  It’s not a new government.  Despite the change  of personnel in various positions it’s the same Tory government that’s been in power for almost 13 years."
"Congratulations PM Rishi Sunak, My wonderful counsel to you to solve UK's economic crisis is please print this words in British pounds in gold stating "" At this time of peace, prosperity, progress & perfection, we rejoice in triumph for all eternity! Alleluia! Amen! "" A wonderful idea! God bless & more success!"
His first call after sworn in as PM is to Ukraine and said his complete support... He will also not stay long 🤣🤣
"For a moment, I was excited. I was hoping against hope, that Great Britain is still great and going to colonise China and lord over those China men again."

He just sounds like a robot reading from a script don’t expect anything with a Tory in charge unless you are rich
"130 people, total, in the whole of the UK, voted for Rishi Sunak. All of those wanted jobs for him. He has zero remit to be PM. Disgraceful. I'm ashamed to be British"
"Well, let's hope the UK will be better under his watch ...
Best of everything to the UK, and this Bloke!"
Wish you luck🍀
I stand with riots right now. Needs a general election not a rich election
"Dear Primer minister of England, congratulations on you becoming a Primer minister of Britain, here us my request to you, my aunty Luarline die after been in England for 60 years, she was as close as a mother to could be, and I would like to attend her funeral,"
"""Y'all didn't vote for me and none of you wanted me. I'm gonna decide your fate."""
You can just hear “I predict a riot” in the background of his speech
Welcome aboard Mr Prime Minister Sunak I hope you bring UK back to the paths of economic prosperity and freedom again🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧❤❤❤
Can someone explain why PM quits so often?
Proud moment 🇮🇳❤❤
"did truss try to be terrible to make Rishi look like a good idea comparatively?
Real ELECTION NOW!"
"BBC ,You can write INDIAN instead of ASIAN."
"… And now the end is here
And so I face that final curtain
My friend I'll make it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more
I did it, I did it my way

… Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
I saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much, much more
I did it, I did it my way

… Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

… For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself then he has naught
Not to say the things that he truly feels
And not the words of someone who kneels
Let the record shows I took all the blows and did it my way"
Holy Mercy...an Asian beauty in & out is something that money couldn't buy... hold tight on him UK !!  It's not an easy job let's think positive ☘☘☘.
Is the audio not syncing right for everyone?
"Disgraceful to think how disconnected this man is from the world we live in, yet he is supposed to represent the people and act in their good interest - almost feels silly to even write it..

Here’s to hoping Scottish independence will someday come true so I dare move to your lovely rock without needing Sunak money in the bank"
"He was speaking English 😀 y dub it?😀 I was here to hear his speech not a dubbing 😀 eventhough its same words, its somebody else's voice 😀"
Like rishi
"I have a feeling he'll just be alright. He certainly doesn't represent anything new when judging by how his rhetoric is as vague, safe and sweeting sounding as ever when compared to literally any other typical politican."
"In 2022, India 🇮🇳 has surpassed UK 🇬🇧 in GDP, and the first Indian 🇮🇳 origin man has ever become the prime minister of the UK 🇬🇧 . Isn't this a remarkable year for Indian people 🇮🇳?"
If our ansestors knew they were giving their lives for nothing
"Godspeed brother.✌️
Show them what indians can do when they're given a chance to prove.
Wish you all the best.
India🇮🇳🇬🇧Britain.🙏🏼"
Best wishes New British Prime Minister .
I knew it from the start that this man is gonna be the prime minister
"a change of PM isn't the solution to their economic woes. It's a global phenomenon. Even if they change PM a thousand times, it won't stop a free fall in GBP in the coming days. Leaving the EU remains their greatest mistake. They never saw the war on Ukraine coming"
"God help us all...this is a disaster letting this rich, entitled man have such power over our country."
How on earth is he going to repay Britain's huge international debt ?
"Can you feel Churchill turning in his grave? India has actually become an intellectual superpower! 

Love and respect from an Indian!"
I said it that he was going to be the next British prime minister. Because David Cameron said that one he see India prime minister on downing Street.
A male monarch and a South Asian as the PM. This really is new era.
"Can we please have a PM that doesn't sound like a soulless scripted robot? And what vegetable should we compare his time in Downing Street to this time? Not confident in him whatsoever, Tories are too much of a mess."
Congratulations Rishi Ji!A few days later is better than nothing.Hopes this country will be stable and on suitable track under your dynamic leadership.We are proud of You.Thank You.
He is Indian but he speaks English accent clearly
"When Rishi Sunak becomes the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Does Mrs Sunak pay her proper tax now she's ( belatedly) adopted the same nationality as the husband?
He seems like a nice guy
So when do we get a chance to vote the Banks administrator out?
Best of luck Rishi bro 😍

"The Kiev regime has already completed technical preparations for a provocation with a ""dirty bomb"", - RIAN 

Specialists of the Ukrainian enterprise Yuzhmash have prepared a dummy rocket of the Iskander complex, which is planned to be filled with radioactive material, and then allegedly shot down over the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by the AFU air defense forces and announce the launch of a nuclear charge by the Russian army, a source familiar with the situation told RIA. 

He clarified that the dummy of the Iskander rocket was made on the basis of the projectile of the Tochka-U missile system: ""After the dummy is ""shot down"", the Kiev authorities intend to show fragments of the mock-up and electronics elements of the alleged Iskander missile to Western and Ukrainian media in order to convince the Western public of Russia's guilt"
Should have been the 1st choice anyway.
"Alright, India became the biggest winner, now not a late time to learn Indian English"
nah bro the king thinks it is april fools
Did he call Liz Struss stupid?!
"Rishi Sunak must not be allowed to become prime minister of Britain 🇬🇧because he is not British, regardless of his being born and raised in Southampton, which does not make him British. His parents were from India. It should not have happened, and it's a disgrace that a person from another country is running our country UK. 🇬🇧 ☹"
Rishi  will recover our own  pride kohinoor Rishi follow footsteps of  Sardar Patel and create a revolution in  Britain
🇮🇳
This is a full circle moment. A colonial becomes the leader of the colonizers.
"UK PM with Indian origin 👀

This should be a big ne—"
"When some say colour doesnt matter as long u’re capable, u ‘re indirectly labelling the incompetence. Do u know why indians around the world are all excited about rishi? Bcos they’re proud of their colour, proud of their origin. And so failure is not an option for rishi, dont let the people down."
Congratulations Mr Rishi sunak 💐 🇮🇳💝🇬🇧 Good Blessing from INDIAN MUSLIM and I'm very happy to see you as a prime minister of UK.

"How can we increase de credit and decrease the debit in UK?
1) Poverty : Government to invest in training and job opportunities, and decrease the birth rate.  Result : Increase the salary level means increase the income taxes. 2)Informal jobs : the Government to show the formal jobs benefits to the population. 3) Education and Research : Work together with industries to supply the industries needs (job opportunities, economics growth, increase export and income taxes) 4) Defense and Space : Unite industries, universities and research centers.  Government focus on results (increase income taxes).  Focus to strengh the UK Companies.5) Agriculture and Natural Resources.6) Turism : Safety, cleaning and Infrastructure investments, etc..."
"Reverse colonisation at it's finest, all jokes aside let's all hope he'll be a good prime-minister"
Okay so business opportunities takes precedent over sorting out inequality and the people in any way. The highest standards of a conservative party. Election now please cause we are just going to go into austerity again if nothing is done.

"new Indian Britain Governor, congrat..."

Hablar de riquezas en estos tiempos es deprimente tanto para los unos como para los otros. Están condenados a llorar y humillarse. Santiago 5:1-6; Apocalipsis 6:1-17 Biblia.

"Yes, but we CAN'T trust you with taxes going to other countries & 1 foot in 2 different countries other than Britain, precisely to reduce your taxes to the country in which you now want this Top Job.

You have behaved like a haggling bizarre merchant, weighing Britons' lives with uneven weights on the scales."

"Does the thing that his big family from grandparents down to him has only rooted Hindu members mean anything? Even though he was born and has lived in a multicultural country! He lives and behaves (and follows) under Hindu culture (obviously, don’t get me wrong) - is that what UK (not any other countries) people and country need? Difference is not discrimination in the case, but it is a different culture.

I reckon he was elected because he is rich, no, very rich and supported by rich Hindu rooted people, in a foreigner view myself. I don’t mean that he is not educated nor talented, please don’t mislead it."
Nice president..
